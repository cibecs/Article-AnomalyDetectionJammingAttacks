\section{Introduction}

The shift from 4G to 5G has been a generational leap has revolutionized connectivity around the world. 
Despite 5G being still in its early adoption rate at the time of writing \cite{5GStatisticsTaylor}, the research community is already working on the next generation of wireless communication technologies, 6G. 
6G technology is expected to enable a wide variety of new use cases, thanks to the increases in both data rates and latency but this in turn 
will also bring forth new security challenges, specific to those applications. 

One of the main differences between 5G and 6G technology will be the focus of the 6G standard in regards to 
AI integration. While Software Defined Networks (SDN) have played a key role in improving the efficiency and security 
of 5G networks, 6G is expected to take this a step further, by integrating artificial
intelligence and machine learning directly into the network. This is what the authors of \cite{6GRoadmapLetaief} define as 
the shift from \textit{Softwarization} to \textit{Intelligentization}.

AI integration in 6G networks will greatly strengthen the security of the network against security threats. 
By leveraging Diagnostic Analytics, a collection of insights into the status of the networks, security teams 
will be able to train specific AI models to detect and respond to security threats in real-time.

In this paper we will focus on a specific aspect of the security of 6G networks, namely we will provide a machine learning based approach 
for the detection of jamming attacks in networks of drones. 

The paper is divided in 5 sections: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Topic overview:} In this section we will discuss how drones can benefit from integration in 6G network, analyze jamming attacks, their types, mitigation and detection. Finally we will discuss the advantages of an edge AI approach for jamming detection. 
	\item \textbf{Materials and methods:} In this section we will define the scenario that we decided to analyze as well as the dataset, algorithm and evaluation metrics we chose for our tests. 
	\item \textbf{Numerical Results:} In this section we will present the testing methodology as well as the numerical results that we obtained. 
	\item \textbf{Discussion:} In this section we will discuss the results obtained in the previous section and highlight notable trends.
	\item \textbf{Conclusions:} In this section we will summarize the results and discuss possible future research directions.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Topic Overview}

\subsection{Drones in 6G Networks}

Drones, also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are defined as \textit{all aircraft designed to fly
without a pilot on board} \cite{DronesEC}. This technology has experienced rapid growth in recent years and is expected to 
keep growing in both the consumer sector as well as the commercial and military sectors \cite{DronesStatisticsLaricchia}.

In report 22.886 \cite{5GV2XSultan} 3GPP, the organ responsible for the development and maintenance of the 5G standard, identifies some of the envisioned use cases for 5G V2X (Vehicle-to-
Everything) communication services. Among these use cases, the report identifies vehicle platooning, advanced and remote driving end extended situational awareness as some of the main benefits
of V2V communication. All these use cases can be leveraged by a 6G drone network to achieve fast and reliable drone-to-drone communication, that, with the integration of artificial intelligence 
would allow the drones to act autonomously in a coordinated manner. 

This would prove useful in a variety of fields: from autonomous soil and crop health assessment as well as irrigation in agriculture, 
delivery of life saving supplies and locating of survivors in disaster response, in the delivery sector as a more eco friendly alternative to traditional 
delivery options and possibly in the mobility sector as a complement to traditional taxis and public transportation \cite{DroneCommHassija}. 

The effectiveness of drones in the military sector is widely recognized, both for high and low end models. For example, in the Ukraine war even cheap FPV drones 
mounted with explosives were successfully used to destroy much more expensive equipment \cite{DroneCombatUkraine}. 

Security against Jamming attacks is crucial in all these applications, especially in a safety critical environment.

\subsection{Formatting of Mathematical Components}

This is the example 1 of equation:
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation}
a = 1,
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath}
the text following an equation need not be a new paragraph. Please punctuate equations as regular text.
%% If the documentclass option "submit" is chosen, please insert a blank line before and after any math environment (equation and eqnarray environments). This ensures correct linenumbering. The blank line should be removed when the documentclass option is changed to "accept" because the text following an equation should not be a new paragraph.

This is the example 2 of equation:
\begin{adjustwidth}{-\extralength}{0cm}
\begin{equation}
a = b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i + j + k + l + m + n + o + p + q + r + s + t + u + v + w + x + y + z
\end{equation}
\end{adjustwidth}

% Example of a page in landscape format (with table and table footnote).
%\startlandscape
%\begin{table}[H] %% Table in wide page
%\caption{This is a very wide table.\label{tab3}}
%	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{CCCC}

%	\begin{adjustwidth}{+\extralength}{0cm}
%		\noindent\footnotesize{\textsuperscript{1} This is a table footnote.}

%\end{table}
%\finishlandscape


Please punctuate equations as regular text. Theorem-type environments (including propositions, lemmas, corollaries etc.) can be formatted as follows:
%% Example of a theorem:
\begin{Theorem}
Example text of a theorem.
\end{Theorem}

The text continues here. Proofs must be formatted as follows:

%% Example of a proof:
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem 1]
